Write a program to create two sets of strings and find common strings between them. Merge sets after removing common strings. Display resultant set. 




import scala.collection.mutable._ 
object set  
{
    def main(args: Array[String]) 
    {     
        var a=Set("om","sham","ram","yash");    
        var b=Set("sham","suyash","prabhu","ram"); 
        
        println("set1 is = "+a)
        println("set2 is = "+b)
        
        val i = a.intersect(b);
        println("common strings are = " +i);
        
        var c = a.++(b);
        var res = c.--(i);
        println("Removing common string the result is = "+ res)
    }
}
